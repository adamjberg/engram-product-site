## What is engram?


engram is a subscription web browser-based open source software application designed as a quick thought and information capture-share tool to help people remember important things in their lives.

If this marketing blurb doesn't make sense to you, let us help by breaking this down and add a few key details for color:


## engram


engram is a very cool new product name that dropped out of the sky on us for a brainstorming project. It is also a real old word that means something; engram describes a process in which a memory makes a physical change in the brain upon recall. The engram app also aims to help memory recall by making physical changes to bits of software code. Items created in engram Notes, Tasks and Events are referred to as engrams.


## Subscription


engram offers a free offline mode (saving local data) for new users to try out features and sample how the app works. By invitation, beta test users receive a full featured subscription login and cloud storage at no charge.


## Open Source


A great place to shamelessly steal somebody else's work. I mean, a wonderful avenue to share and contribute to coding for all of humanity. engram includes installation instructions and documentation for open source use of our code. Our learning experience as a business startup will also be shared through blogs and social media.


## Software Application


We used to call computer software "programs" - then "application" was the thing. Maybe that's because programmers are always filling out job applications, but even so nobody used that big word for long. It's now just app – in this case it means to apply coding parameters in an executable file on a phone or computing device.


## Thought & Information Capture


A thought or idea can come to mind at any time, and a barrage of information comes in from all sides at nearly all times – enough to blot out the sun. Stuff comes into your orbit faster than you can figure out which planet to put it on. While there are countless note-taking, task-management and time organizing programs available for end use, very few function well as ready quick-capture tools. engram is a to-the-point, fast front-end funnel for day-to-day data.


## Share


Once captured - reconsidered, filtered and distilled information is then more valuable to the originator and their network. engrams can be set to Note, Task or Event at any time, and can be moved to different customized Workspaces for organizations.  To quickly share, one engram might need to be delivered through Telegram; another through email; another using a Zapier or other 3rd party action. Eventually all of the most common communication platforms will be supported with 2-click interchange.


## Help Remember


The meaning of engram is to describe a process for which there is a physical change in the brain upon memory recall. We are hoping the engram app lives up to its name in this regard – to aid in memory recall. If a user takes the time to write, speak or copy a block of information, it will surely help to know that information survives and persists past the next thought. They will more likely remember that they remembered to put it in the app – automatic memory reinforcement.


## What does engram do?


The brainstorm mission for engram was to build an eminently functional app with a minimal footprint and the least complication for fastest performance. The result: engram is primarily a quick note taking application with downstream data share and distribution capabilities. 

When inspiration strikes and information needs to be committed to history, a transfer medium needs to be at the ready. It so happens that you probably have your phone handy more than old-fashioned pen and paper, so digital is good. 

So a thought occurs- does this new bit of information belong in OneNote, Twitter, Facebook, My Files, Word – or What Have You? Do I add this to my Task list and have to look at all 37 (and growing) undone tasks again? The stress of making the right choice hinders that very moment when thinking is critical. 

engram makes the input decision easy. 


## Notes Ingest


In engram Log mode, every entry moment starts with an empty slate – a blank page with a ready line for text entry. No clutter or distractions – just focus on getting the word in edgewise.

If your browser supports microphone input on the default keyboard, you may speak your thoughts and have them converted directly to text.

Text from other applications can be pasted into the engram Command Line Interface (CLI).

Log entry Notes originally appear in order on the date of creation, so next steps on that item's organization or output can be taken immediately, later – or never if not needed.


## Conversion to Tasks & Events


Notes can be edited with a sub-level expandable indentation structure, and converted to Tasks or Events if progress warrants the status upgrade.

All engrams may be moved to Workspaces so you may have a separate set of Notes, Tasks and Events associated with a custom Workspace you create. [Note – not active in current version]

Pages can be created for use as general information repositories, not necessarily attached to N-T-E.

Once entered, an engram can then be forwarded directly to another application so you can share on email or your favorite social media app.


## What does engram not do?


engram is not the be-all-to-end-all magic bullet life savior pill that does all the work and dishes in life for you. engram can however, help streamline the daily information gathering process, but sorry - thinking is still an individual responsibility. The benefits gained will be solely gleaned from the grind put into such an information system.

As very early beta software, you can expect the odd bit of weird (or weird bit of odd) behavior when using the app. It is not likely you will lose data, but be aware that moving things around multiple times via drag and drop can get things mixed up. engram beta may not yet work with 100% reliability, but you can expect a high degree of useability and that fixes are forthcoming.

engram does not make a pile of files to get lost somewhere – each is self-contained in the app with a chronological assignment. Individual note files are inefficient, whether in an application or created by the user. Simple items don't need a whole file system to manage, they just need a line or two in the right place to start.

Product security is always a permanent focus – please be aware that though it is a near term goal, encryption is not currently enabled on engram data. Because anyone can get hacked these days, we suggest you do not use engram for highly sensitive or proprietary materials or information at this time.


## What does engram hope to do when it grows up?


There exists an eternal struggle for ego-maniacal software developers to provide the leanest and most efficient code but also the widest feature set known to man at the same time. There is a temptation to put in a kitchen sink because we can. We sometimes have to slap ourselves back to the former lean when the pi in the skype thinking takes over temporarily.

### Reminder to selves: lean with the wind - do not pi into it...

What is the need and solution for instant and constant input? Not so long ago the human brain did not have to deal with so many diverse streams coming into our consciousness. As predisposed overthinkers, the engram team knows firsthand that it is a helpful habit and trait to get things off your mind. If you don't, one good thought might get overwritten in your mind by the next one.

Ultimately it is our goal for engram to be measurably helpful to convert a user's thoughts, ideas and information into actions. If engram can get people used to forming productive habits using this tool, then we have accomplished something worthwhile.

A parallel mission for engram is to provide inline educational software development training for students interested in similar lines of productivity software. Development progress can be followed on GitHub and various social media outlets. It does us no harm for others to benefit from our expertise and experience.
 

## What can you do to help?


Instant access to an inputting app is perhaps not something you thought you needed - after all, you got this far in life without one. If you don't regularly scribble, doodle or jot notes this app is probably not going to change your behavior significantly – but with a little push, engram might just change the way you think about consolidating your personal data I/O.

After reading through this diatribe, if you are still interested in giving engram a spin: congratulations and welcome to the team. Just between us, we would greatly appreciate your feedback on all aspects of the application:

###   ease of use and usefulness
###   how you use it and how you don't
###   colors, fonts and design
###   what you think it could or should do
###   new feature priorities
###   server and browser performance evaluation
###   business and opportunity advice
###   bug notes and reporting

We would like interactive user partners to make the most interactive product for the next users. Your comments and suggestions will certainly guide the next rounds of feature planning and execution of features and functions.

You have chosen a mission that can really help but can't really hurt. This message will never self-destruct in 5 seconds.

Thank you,
*the engram team*
