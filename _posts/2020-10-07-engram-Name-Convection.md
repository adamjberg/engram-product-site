How do you pick a worthy buzzword for a product that doesn't quite exist yet? Without a company and/or product/service name you aren't shovel-ready for marketing; you can't fully proceed effectively with logo design, marketing materials, promotions or external communication. Sure, progress can be made on other fronts, but we need an identity pronto.

Your [Name] says everything about you – sometimes by design but mostly by reputation. When you don't have a reputation in a new field, by design takes precedence. Creating a unique and memorable name and logo was going to be an important feature to embed into Project Brainstorm.


## No Calm Before the Brainstorm

In the mindsearch for name to front a brainstormed idea, a pile of brainstormed (and a few hairbrained) names crossed the groupthink threshold:

* ###    Coyou
* ###    Co-pilot
* ###    Mindgap
* ###    Thotjot
* ###    Mindlist
* ###    Maximind
* ###    LYF
* ###    Brainyak
* ###    Mindstorm
* ###    wickidea
* ###    wikidea
     (and so on...)

A lot of company and product name research centers around what is available out there on the internet, and let's just say that most of the goodmonikers.com are taken. None of these made up names stayed rattling in our minds, so radar stayed up for something unique.
 

## Scientific Thought Echo


I try to read scientific publications on brain function research whenever I see them. Given that we were in progress to build a quick thought-jot application, I had been wondering how the natural memory process works and how that might be applied to the product in development. Why do we need all these tools when the brain can do it all on its own? Everyone can think all day, but what do they really do about it? 

The word engram jumped out at me while reading from the page of a Quanta Magazine article explaining a physical process for recalling memories:

*"More than a century ago, the zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to designate the physical trace a memory must leave in the brain, like a footprint."* [Quanta article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brain-cell-dna-refolds-itself-to-aid-memory-recall-20201102)

In a sense, the app we were building is refolding data to aid in memory recall – could we learn from the engram process and incorporate the concept in the structure of the program?


## What is the biological engram process?

Studies find that neurons activate as we form a memory and reactivate as we remember it, strengthening the connections. If a memory is jogged or primed, it becomes ingrained – hard-wired into the back end of the mind after multiple firings. That makes sense – why use precious energy and resources if not necessary? 

Technically, parts of the chromatin (protein, RNA, and DNA) are reorganized in such a way that made the genes in that DNA more accessible to genetic elements that can increase the activation of genes. 

*"Semon found evidence in the way that different parts of the body relate to each other involuntarily, such as "reflex spasms, co-movements, sensory radiations," to infer distribution of "engraphic influence."* [Richard Semon - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Semon)

The engram process is clearly important for much downstream thought processing. There are demonstrated correlations of neuronal activities to the ingest, remembering and recalling of information used in digital processing systems:

+ ###   **Encoding**
+ ###   **Retention**
+ ###   **Retrieval**
+ ###   **Activity**

Expanding the memory process to fit a business process progression model, there are obvious parallels to the goals and processes of productivity software development:

- ###   **Observation**
- ###   **Orientation**
- ###   **Decisions**
- ###   **Actions**
- ###   **Measurement**
- ###   **Reporting**

In our case Stage One product development focused on acquiring user data and relating data points to physical actions (what to do with the data item?). 


## How to Model Information Tools on the Biological Engram Process?


![engram Dashboard]({{"/images\Trace-Place-Retrace-1200.png" | relative_url}})

*"Memory formation is not instantaneous … the act of remembering is crucial to locking a memory into the brain."* [*Quanta article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brain-cell-dna-refolds-itself-to-aid-memory-recall-20201102)


In a sentence, that captured much of the mindset that Project Brainstorm was going to be about. You can have a thousand thoughts a day, but most get washed away with the next one. If you don't take down that thought somewhere - somehow, chances are it will not be remembered as well later on.

There is a fair comparable to a thought-recording digital product that produces a physical trace with reinforced data – a silicon-embedded footprint to return to for further orientation and direction rather than organic. In either case, new memories are "use it or lose it" moments in time. We all get to choose what is most important to us, and our life literally follows those choices.

Thoughts come on rapid fire whether you are prepared or not. Pen and paper are perfect for instant note-taking, but is a dead end street (not to mention a dead tree) that may require duplication for long term use. A digital engram capture tool needs to be fast, clear to the point, and not get in the way of the idea in the first place.

Get the thought out in its immediacy – decide what to do a little or a lot later. Worry about how to turn those thoughts and inputs into action later. Basic ideas posted in the form of notes can turn into tasks and events to set for yourself and others. These are easy but effective steps to filling your day with activities that matter at the right time.


## Think Twice


Rather than try to create the be-all-to-end-all program, a personal brainstorm tool that front-ends everything else out there seems to be very necessary in this world of segmented and siloed online marketplaces. The mental recall process can be directed digitally in a wide variety of manners – the key point is going to be in facilitating that second step of the productive process.


*"Understanding at the molecular level how the brain cements some memories and loses others could create opportunities to influence aging, learning and other essential processes."* [*Quanta article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brain-cell-dna-refolds-itself-to-aid-memory-recall-20201102)


Similarly, an easy to use life-minder application could be advanced and used to deliver influential content, such as education/training courses, health and wellness, financial fitness and limitless plug-ins given the supported open-source community. That is a lot to think about – good thing we are building a tool to dream such things in real time.


## engram Fits Our DNA

 
The word engram made its own permanent imprint on our minds – a brainstorm lightning bolt that fired an instant bond to the synapses. The word itself is old but new research has given it new life. Not a made up or too common word or name (as is the current fashion) but engram might be the most important memory nobody heard of before.

engram (our styled lower case) as a productivity product name is a fortunate and perfectly descriptive tag to apply over Project Brainstorm. It's short, easy to understand and surely easy to brand. Building the application suddenly becomes more meaningful without that big hole in the genetic code of the product. We fully expect to do the engram concept well and make it live up to its name:


*engram is an open source knowledge management application designed to help individuals convert their ideas into actions and to help educate those interested in software development.*
