Technology changes so fast, you sometimes don't know whether to laugh or cry. Everyone else is making a billion dollars making all the same social media morass, but you are not. You have a possible forever choice to make – pay to use data or get paid to make. If you are capable to accomplish the latter, the journey will still likely be long on a road littered with failed products – still the better option. 

How do you create a product that ideally solves an old problem in a new way? The obvious answer is to challenge obstacles head-on with unique creative thinking, and by exercising the ability to quickly try and test measured ideas toward progress. 

 

## Plum d'Name 

 

When developing a new digital device product from start (not often the case), it is not immediately necessary to select a name that will identify that product for its life cycle. Code names or project names are perfectly fine temporary vehicles of persuasion, even if not remotely close to the final moniker. Product design and engineering should not pause a minute to sort out a brand name, unless predetermined or obvious from the start. A project code name will do at this stage. 

 

Figuring out what's already been done is easy. A quick search of the internet shows that a digital application already exists online for just about everything you can think of related to productivity. In our case there was no sense in making something new of something old – some refined thought has to go into this. If only we had a cool program to do that! 

 

## Start With A Simple Goal 

 

Our long-stewing brainstorm project represents as complete a fresh start as you can get ((save for [and saved by] open source)). With a simple goal of designing a very basic but fast thought/idea/note-taking tool, plotting (and plodding) activity began – several brains storming, but only two hands coding. 

 

We started with no preconceived notions, but certainly a few heads full of what_could_I_really_use? ideas for features and functions that might be useful. The Wishlist grew exponentially – and unrealistically, given we just said we were doing a basic project. What was going to stick? What was going to be the shared killer idea that makes this product attractive? Eventually a brainstorming meeting was called, and of all things "Project Brainstorm" became the holding name for the initial thoughtworks. 

 

## Brainstorm About Brainstorm 

 

It also turns out that brainstorming was the product idea for Project Brainstorm. This was not destined to be another Note-Taker but a Knowledge Management tool. What good is having a great thought if it never gets recorded, thought about again, or acted upon in an organized manner? We want to create a private, collaborative method of collecting and sharing thoughts, spoken words and media bits, with the side benefit of guiding into actions and activities.

We need to make a barnstorming brainstorming product. Proceeding on that note.
